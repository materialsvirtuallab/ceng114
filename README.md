# CENG/NANO 114

Welcome to the repo for CENG/NANO114.

CENG114 is UCSD's course on Probability and Statistics and their Application
to Science and Engineering taught by Prof Shyue Ping Ong. The purpose of this 
repo is to serve as a persistent and evolving collection of supplementary 
course materials that illustrate various probability and statistics concepts. 
Most of the code are written in python and presented in ipython notebooks.

While this repo is completely open and anyone is welcome to use the materials 
contained therein, I would ask that you acknowledge any usage.

## Usage

To fully make use of this repo, you need python 2.7+, numpy, scipy, pandas, ipython, 
matplotlib and prettyplotlib.

However, you can explore a lot of the materials without any installation.

### Viewing the Notebooks

You can explore the notebooks using the excellent online ipython notebook viewer. 
To begin, go to this [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsvirtuallab/ceng114/tree/master/lectures/)
which points to the root lectures directory.

## Acknowledgements

CENG114 uses the following highly recommended textbooks.
